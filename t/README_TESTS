For the network tests, there needs to be some hardware setup to make them pass.

The hardware that these tests should be run against should not be in 
production.  These tests may disrupt normal functioning of the hardware.

There are three types of tests, each with different requirements.  AP Tests, 
SU Tests and Association Tests.  

The configuration is read from a tests.cfg file in the t directory.  This
file is generated by Build.PL, but you can create or modify it yourself.
This file is a plain text file set up as key<tab>value. 

AP Tests:

These tests run on an AP.  They require that you have an AP that is set up
and accessible through telnet.  

It uses two fields from the config file:
    AP:        the IP address of the AP
    AP_PASSWD: the password to login to the AP

There are also a few subtests that can be run, these involve adding and 
removing things from the SUDB.  Generally they are used with the Association 
Tests, but they can be tested if you provide additional information.

The fields used for these tests are as follow:
    SU_ID:  The SUID of the SU
    SU_MAC: The MAC address (all 12 digits, no spaces or punctuation)


SU Tests:

These tests run on an SU.  They require that you have an SU that is set up
and accessible through telnet.  

It uses two fields from the config file:
    SU:        the IP address of the SU
    SU_PASSWD: the password to login to the SU


Association Tests:

These tests require everything above is set up, and the SU should be set up 
so that when you add an entry to the APs SUDB it will associate.  That means 
the SU should have that SUID set already, and the freq scantable should include 
the freq that is set on the AP.

The tests will change the su password and su ipconfig, so the SU IP should 
be in the same subnet as the AP IP.
