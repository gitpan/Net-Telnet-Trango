Add additional commands

Make a decoder for the pipe command

Make sure that last_error is used wherever it can be and should be.

Make sure that things that fail don't evaluate true if at all possible.

See what other tests need to be added to the test suite.  The framework is there, but there need to be more tests of the different commands.
