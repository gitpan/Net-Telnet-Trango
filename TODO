Add additional commands

Make a decoder for the pipe command

Make sure that last_error is used wherever it can be and should be.

Make sure that things that fail don't evaluate true if at all possible.

See what other tests need to be added to the test suite.  The framework is there, but there need to be more tests of the different commands.

Make the _decode_lines be able to take a line without a "\n" at the end.

make tests for new subs:
	set_defaultopmode
	set_baseid
	set_suid
	freq
	freq_writescan
	ipconfig
	reset
