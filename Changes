Revision history for Net-Telnet-Trango

        * Fix a mistake I made in the match for sudb_view. I should probably
          get a test environment set up.  Hopefully that is the last problem
          Steven has to work around for a while.

        * Match the su2su field in sudb_view, it is in hex, so \d didn't match
          sometimes.  Thanks again to "Steven N. Severinghaus"
        * More tests that are probably non-functional because I didn't set up
          a test environment.

0.02    2009.07.08
