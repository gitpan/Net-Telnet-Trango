Revision history for Net-Telnet-Trango

0.05    2009.07.31
        * no longer store config in a shared %PRIVATE hash, 
          now do it the same way as Net::Telnet and store it 
          as part of the object.  When using more than one object 
          (say an AP and and SU) the config would be shared.
        * Add several new commands useful for managing SU
          - reset
          - set_baseid
          - set_suid
          - set_defaultopmode
          - freq
          - freq_writescan
          - freq_scantable
          - ipconfig
        * new commands don't have tests yet, but it is in the TODO

        * Fix a mistake I made in the match for sudb_view. I should probably
          get a test environment set up.  Hopefully that is the last problem
          Steven has to work around for a while.

        * Match the su2su field in sudb_view, it is in hex, so \d didn't match
          sometimes.  Thanks again to "Steven N. Severinghaus"
        * More tests that are probably non-functional because I didn't set up
          a test environment.

0.02    2009.07.08
        * Perltidy and some Perl Critic
        * Changed the prompt to include $> not just #>
        * Changed the banner match to support more types of hardware
        * Lots of tests
        * Added stuff to the TODO
        * Support for the TrangoLink 45
        * Additional features in the su.cgi
        * Add commands arq and linktest
        * Fix a problem in sudb_add where $new_mac wasn't completely
          stripped of special characters.
